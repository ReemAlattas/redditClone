# A Reddit Clone built with Meteor.js

I built this "social media aggregator" site for Coursera's Intro to Meteor course.

Nothing too fancy, but it does implement some nice features like tracking user accounts voting history (so each user can only upvote or downvote once), as we all as automatically generating descriptions for submitted URLs by triggering a server-side method that will grab the HTML from the URL and parse out the `<title>` tag.
